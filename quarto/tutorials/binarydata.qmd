# Retrieving citable binary data



You can retrieve image data from a IIIF service using Cite2 URNs.


## IIIF requests

First you need need to instantiate a IIIF service. You need to know its base URL and the path to the root directory for the service.

```{julia}
using CitableImage
baseurl = "http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv"
root = "/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom"
service = IIIFservice(baseurl, root)
```    

The `url` function can then form IIIF requests for a service given an image's URN.


```{julia}
using CitableObject
img = Cite2Urn("urn:cite2:hmt:vaimg.2017a:VA012RN_0013")

iifrequest = url(img, service)
```

You could use the resulting URL to directly request binary image data, and work with it using Julia packages like `Images`.

```{julia}
using Downloads
imgfile = Downloads.download(iifrequest)

using Images, FileIO  
img = load(imgfile)
rm(imgfile)
img
```
